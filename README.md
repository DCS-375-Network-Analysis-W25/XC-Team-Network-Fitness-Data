# Does Being More Socially Connected in Training Improve Fitness Among Bates Women’s Cross Country Athletes?

This project explores whether athletes who are more socially connected in training tend to show greater fitness improvement over the course of a cross country season. Using Garmin/Strava data and self-reported training ties from the Bates women’s cross country team, I built a social network to analyze patterns between training connections and changes in heart rate-to-pace ratio. The goal is to see if being part of a more connected training group has any relationship to individual performance gains.

### Included Files:
- XCdata.Rmd — R Markdown file with all code and analysis

- XCdata.html — Rendered HTML report showing network graphs, visualizations, and findings

- EdgeList_FitnessData.xlsx — Cleaned dataset with training ties and Garmin/Strava data from teammate survey responses

The analysis was done using R, with packages like igraph and tidyverse to build the network and explore relationships through visualizations, statistics, and basic modeling.
